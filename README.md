> **IMPORTANT**: Modify `LICENSE` with your preferred license text. If you are fine with MIT, add your name and year.

> What the sections below should be used for:
>
> `## Installation`: Leave this section un-edited unless you have some specific additional installation procedure.

>
> * Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
> * When you release a new version, update `VERSION` and `git tag` it (use `make release` if you can)
